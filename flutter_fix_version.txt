# How to Fix Flutter Version Issues

Whenever you upgrade Flutter or face Gradle errors related to Flutter path, follow these steps:

1. Check your Flutter version:
   ```
   flutter --version
   ```

2. Verify the Flutter SDK path in your project:
   ```
   cat android/local.properties | grep flutter.sdk
   ```

3. If the versions don't match, update local.properties:
   ```
   # Replace X.X.X with your current Flutter version
   sed -i '' 's|flutter.sdk=.*|flutter.sdk=/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/flutter/X.X.X/flutter|' android/local.properties
   ```

4. If problems persist, recreate the Android files:
   ```
   flutter clean
   flutter create --platforms=android .
   ```

5. For a complete reset:
   ```
   flutter clean
   rm -rf ~/.gradle/daemon
   rm -rf android/.gradle
   flutter create --platforms=android .
   ```

These steps should resolve most Flutter version-related Gradle issues.
